## Summary {#summary}

The Catan VR League takes place over a roughly one-month season. Beginning with a several week, open-play ‘Regular Season’ period, the Top-16 are invited to the Playoffs--which includes a four-group semifinal round, whereby the four advancing finalists play in the Championship Match! We also have seasonal honorable-mention awards for most games-played and similar noteworthy achievements.

## Playing

Members of our Catan VR discord are welcome to participate with other discord members in 3-player and 4-player League Matches. Before a match begins, all players should confirm and be aware of the discord usernames of the players involved for our match reporting purposes.

At the conclusion of a league match, the match result should be promptly posted by one of the participating players (often the winning player) in the ‘League Match Reporting’ discord text channel.

### Reporting Matches

Our league members post completed league matches on discord, in a dedicated sub-channel for this purpose. We utilize an automated system and discord bot we have lovingly dubbed 'Cato,' to assist with our tabulation process. This system requires a format whereby league match report must include three primary components:

1. The text “#score” (this will activate Cato to facilitate with league match tabulation.)
2. Correctly tagged discord usernames for all participating players (their names turn blue when properly tagged.)
3. The number of Victory Points each player achieved, listed right after each participating tagged player.

The next required step is a validation step, whereby we ask that at least one participating player (other than the posting player) to  “react” by adding an emoji to the match report discord post, to confirm the occurrence of the match and the report’s accuracy to the best of their knowledge. After these two steps are completed, a league admin will later certify the match report for it to be tabulated into our league standings.

Cato is designed to reject 'defective' match reports if certain attrivutes or deficiencies are recognized--such as the bot detects an included player is not correctly tagged such that their name turns blue. It will reject the post and prompt the submitting player to correct and try re-submitting the match report.

A properly submitted and validated match report should look generally like this soon after a match concludes ^

**Match Report Errors:** should a participating player observe an error exists within a recent match report, please notify the discord member who posted it, such that they may edit the match report to correct any mistakes believed to have occurred. Note that, if that match report post happened to have been already emoji'd by another participating player from the match, this later edit of the post will wipe all existing validations--such that at least one new validation will then be necessary following the edit for the report to be accepted.

### League Scoring 

### Match Win Bonuses: {#scoring}

Our league standings are based on a weighted average calculation of the cumulative matches in which our members participated. Primarily, we utilize a weighted average forumla, which entails 4-Player matches having slightly more 'weight' compared to 3-Player matches, as incorporated into our tabulations, in-part with consideration of the dissimilar aspects between such matches. Additionally, for each league match, the winning player is awarded a Win Bonus of *5-Points for 4-Player matches and *3-Points for 3-Player matches,* for their victory of that individual match.

## Playoffs

### Min Match Requirement

To be eligible for the playoffs, players are required to participate in a minimum of **15 League Matches** in the Regular Season period. To incentivize further gameplay beyond this primary threshold, active league players who meet a secondary threshold of *30 League Matches* will benefit by an adjustment of their final weighted average, whereby their average will be rounded up to the next .25 point.

### Playoff Groups:

The Top 16 at the conclusion of our Regular Season will be seeded into 4 Groups of 4 Players for a Semifinal Round, to coordinate and play a best-of-three 3-Match series.  Four finalists will advance from each of these groups to the single, winner-take-all Championship Match. While the group-stage semifinal is best-of-three, should there be a tie for wins following their three matches in any given group, the advancing player will be determined by tiebreaker considerations--first comparing each players’ total points achieved in the 3-Match series, and second, if necessary, by comparing the players’ relative rankings from the three matches in their series.

## Miscellaneous League/Discord Guidelines:

### ‘Casual’ & ‘League’ Matches:

We encourage active participation in the league. A match that occurs between known or identified discord members, without express acknowledgment, may be properly considered and reported as a league match, by the process delineated above.

Yet just because a player is a member of our discord community doesn’t mean they must play official league matches with other discord members; anyone may play for fun if they so choose. If a player desires for whatever reason not to play a league match, they must explicitly state this intention before the match begins, with the players proceeding in agreement with this understanding, otherwise the match may be considered and reported as a league match. (Though not strictly required, it’s a recommended practice to get general group acknowledgment that it’s a league match at the time the match begins, around the same time the joining players are being confirmed as identified members within our discord community.)

### Non-Discord Online Players & League Play:

We always welcome new members to engage with and participate in our community. But for league purposes, 'league matches' are those which are played and reported between identified members of our discord at the beginning of the match. We *always* encourage our discord members to invite new players they encounter online to join and participate in our community and league.

If a new, unknown player joins an open lobby of yours, and they join our discord following your invitation before the match begins, you may certainly engage with and report the results of a league match including them. (Remember that our discord bot, Cato, will reject match reports including non-discord members!)

But regarding new or non-discord players online who can’t, or don’t wish to join for reasons of their own, please consider indulging them in a match to enrich the general online experience and broader community. We don’t want our community and league to unduly contribute to someone’s inability to play online with others in Catan VR.

### Technical issues:

As with any digital, online game, technical difficulties occur from time to time, and represent a challenging aspect to our intentions of fairly administrating league competition. Though it is difficult to indicate comprehensive guidelines, generally, if a player should glitch out of a match, the match unfortunately must be scrapped for our league purposes. Given this general procedure regarding glitches has an obvious potential for abuse, if you suspect such abuse is occurring, or notice unsettling consistency by a player, feel free to direct message me (@doubl) or another league admin on discord about it. We'll do our best to look into the matter, to assess the situation and the players involved. While we generally adopt a friendly approach, and don't pre-judge, warnings may be given at a certain point depending on the circumstances, with more consequential measures possible upon suspected abuse by a player continuing to occur.

### Conduct:

Within our discord, and as it extends to league-related activity within Catan VR, understand that we’re committed to fostering a welcoming, fair, and respectful community. We do not tolerate harassment of any kind, including intimidation or threats, disruptive activity, unwanted sexual attention, bullying, stalking, or extreme and offensive language clearly beyond reasonable frustration that may be expressed in the context of online competitive game-play. Players shall exhibit kindness, courtesy, and fair play to others during league play and within our discord. League Admins may warn, suspend, disqualify, or ban players from participation in current or future league activities and involvement in the Discord community.

Because this is a discord community, there are implicit terms and standards for user conduct that you should be aware of and conform to. These can be reviewed at the following link: https://discordapp.com/guidelines. Notably, members of this discord server should never reveal private information about other members. Such conduct will be considered very serious and not tolerated, and could promptly result in suspension or a ban from the community.

Issues may arise in-game between players that might easily be rectified, without issue, if the same event were to occur playing Settlers of Catan in-person. Despite Catan VR offering an impressively similar experience, we encourage players to be considerate of the constraints of this inherent to any digital game, and encourage amicable resolutions to conflicts that may occur, such as simple trade-backs in the instance of clearly mistaken or misunderstood trades. While poor gameplay does not, by itself, present an issue requiring admin attention, we discourage express or overt gameplay that is excessively unbalanced to apparent match leaders, or that otherwise seem to involve decision-making and considerations of factors concerning one’s general league performance, or to affect another’s as unrelated to that match. If you are offput by actions of another player in our community, please reach out to the league admins, we’d be happy to discuss the situation further.
