## Summary {#summary}

The Catan VR League takes place over a roughly 1-month season, beginning with a several week, open-play ‘Regular Season’ period, and culminating with a Playoff—which includes a Semifinal Round amongst the Top 16, and a Championship Match played amongst the four advancing finalists.

## Playing

Members of our Catan VR discord are welcome to participate with other discord members in 3-player and 4-player League Matches. Before a match begins, all players should confirm and be aware of the discord usernames of the players involved for our match reporting purposes.

At the conclusion of a league match, the match result should be promptly posted by one of the participating players (often the winning player) in the ‘League Match Reporting’ discord text channel.

### Reporting

A proper league match report has three primary components:

1. The text “#score” (this will activate our discord bot, Cato, to facilitate with league match tabulation.)
2. Correctly tagged discord usernames for all participating players (they turn blue when properly tagged.)
3. The number of Victory Points each player achieved, listed right after each participating tagged player.

The second required step is a validating action, whereby at least one participating player other than the posting player must “React” by adding an emoji to the match report post, to confirm the occurrence of the match and the report’s accuracy to the best of their knowledge. Once these two steps are completed, an admin will certify the match report for it to be tabulated.

Cato is designed to reject match reports if certain common defects are recognized, such as the bot detects an included player is not correctly tagged such that their name turns blue. It will reject the post and prompt the submitting player to correct and try re-submitting the match report.

A properly submitted and validated match report should look generally like this soon after a match concludes ^

**Match Report Errors:** should a participating player observe an error exists within a recent match report, please notify the discord member who posted it, and prompt them to correct any mistakes believe to have occurred. If the match report post happened to have been validated by another player from the match, the editing action will wipe all existing validations, such that at least one new validation will be required following the edit for the report to be certified.

### League Scoring 

### Match Win Bonuses: {#scoring}

Our league standings are based on the weighted average of a player’s cumulative matches in which they participated. We utilize a weighted average calculation, whereby 4-Player matches are weighted slightly higher than 3-Player matches when incorporated into our tabulations, in consideration of the dissimilar aspects between such matches. Additionally, for each league match, the winning player is awarded a Win Bonus of 5-Points for 4-Player matches and 3-Points for 3-Player matches.

## Playoffs

### Min Match Requirement

To be eligible for the playoffs, players are required to participate in a minimum of 15 League Matches in the Regular Season.  To incentivize gameplay beyond this primary threshold, active league players who meet a secondary threshold of 30 League Matches will benefit by an adjustment of their final weighted average, whereby it will be rounded up to the next .25 point.

### Playoff Groups:

The Top 16 at the conclusion of our Regular Season will be seeded into 4 Groups of 4 Players for a Semifinal Round, to coordinate and play a 3-Match Series, whereby four finalists will advance from these four groups to the 1-Match, winner-take-all Championship Match. The advancing player from each Semifinal group is determined first by their number of wins, with the first tiebreaker comparing each players’ total points earned in the 3-Match series, and second, if necessary, by comparing the players’ relative rankings from the three matches in their series.

## Miscellaneous League/Discord Guidelines:

### ‘Casual’ & ‘League’ Matches:

We encourage active participation in the league. A match that occurs between adequately identified discord members may properly be considered and reported as a league match, as delineated above, without express acknowledgment. Yet just because a player is a member of our discord community doesn’t mean they must play league matches with other discord members.

If a player desires for whatever reason not to play a league match, they must explicitly state this intention before the match begins, with the players proceeding in agreement with this understanding, otherwise the match may be considered and reported as a league match. (Though not strictly required, it’s a recommended practice to get general group acknowledgment that it’s a league match at the time the match begins, around the same time the joining players are being identified as members within our discord community.)

### Non-Discord Online Players & League Play:

While we always welcome new participation, league matches are those which are played and reported between identified members of our discord at the beginning of the match. We always encourage our discord members to invite new players they encounter online to join and participate in our community and league.

If a new, unknown player joins an open lobby of yours, and they join our discord following your invitation before the match begins, this game may be considered and reported as a league match. (Remember that Cato, our discord bot, will reject match reports including non-discord members!)

But regarding new or non-discord players online who can’t, or don’t wish to join for reasons of their own, please consider indulging them in a match to enrich the general online experience. We don’t want our community to unduly contribute to someone’s inability to play online with others in Catan VR.

### Technical issues:

As with any digital, online game, technical difficulties occur from time to time, and represent a challenging aspect to our intentions of fairly administrating league competition. Though it is difficult to indicate comprehensive guidelines, generally, if a player should glitch out of a match, the match unfortunately must be scrapped for our league purposes. Given this general procedure regarding glitches has an obvious potential for abuse, if you suspect such abuse is occurring, feel free to direct message me (@doubl) or another league admin on discord to assess the situation and the players involved. Warnings may be issued following such events, depending on the circumstances, with more consequential measures possible upon suspected abuse by a player continuing to occur.

### Conduct:

Within our discord, and as it extends to league-related activity within Catan VR, understand that we’re committed to fostering a welcoming, fair, and respectful community. We do not tolerate harassment of any kind, including intimidation or threats, disruptive activity, unwanted sexual attention, bullying, stalking, or extreme and offensive language clearly beyond reasonable frustration that may be expressed in the context of online competitive game-play. Players shall exhibit kindness, courtesy, and fair play to others during league play and within our discord. League Admins may warn, suspend, disqualify, or ban players from participation in current or future league activities and involvement in the discord community.

Issues may arise in-game between players that might easily be rectified, without issue, if the same event were to occur playing Settlers of Catan in-person. Despite Catan VR offering an impressively similar experience, we encourage players to be considerate of the constraints of this inherent to any digital game, and encourage amicable resolutions to conflicts that may occur, such as simple trade-backs in the instance of clearly mistaken or misunderstood trades. While poor gameplay does not, by itself, present an issue requiring admin attention, we discourage express or overt gameplay that is excessively unbalanced to apparent match leaders, or that otherwise seem to involve decision-making and considerations of factors concerning one’s general league performance, or to affect another’s as unrelated to that match. If you are offput by actions of another player in our community, please reach out to the league admins, we’d be happy to discuss the situation further.
