### Versioning

We version procedural changes under the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Changes which signifigantly change previous rules & regulations bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Typo fixes and grammar / misc changes bumps the patch


### Proposals

Any league member may submit a proposal to the community. Before submitting a proposal, you should first create an issue with [Proposal] in the title. The proposal should describe the reason for the proposal, as well as implementation ideas. The proposal will then be reviewed and open for discussion among community members before going up for a vote. Once a proposal is approved, it will be implemented the following season. Proposals which do not follow this guideline will be closed immediately.

Pull requests for bugs/typos may be sent without creating any proposal issue. If you believe that you know of a solution for a bug that has been filed, please leave a comment detailing your proposed fix.
